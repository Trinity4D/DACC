## Features

- Canonical structure for Namespaces, Types, Classes, Fields, Properties, Methods, Interfaces, and Containers.
- Deterministic runtime behavior for AI agents.
- Modular and extendable design using supporting libraries.
- Minimal but precise specification to guide agent construction and execution.
